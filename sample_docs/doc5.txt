A dense fog clung to the forest floor, curling around the twisted roots and fallen branches like a living thing. Birds called out in short, uncertain notes, their songs muffled by the thick air. Somewhere in the distance, the faint splash of water hinted at a hidden stream, trickling steadily through the underbrush. The forest felt ancient, its silence filled with unspoken stories and the quiet watchfulness of unseen creatures.

On the edge of the woods, an old cabin stood with its windows glowing faintly against the gray morning light. Smoke rose lazily from the chimney, a sign of life within. Inside, the fire crackled as a kettle began to steam, and a pair of boots rested near the hearth, drying slowly from an early morning trek. The world outside might be unpredictable and wild, but within those wooden walls, there was warmth, familiarity, and the promise of another peaceful day.
